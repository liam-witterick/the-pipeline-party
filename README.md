# the-pipeline-party

Welcome to The Pipeline Party, a repository dedicated to automating the build, test, and deployment process using multiple CI/CD technologies. Here, you'll find a variety of pipeline scripts that demonstrate how to achieve the same goal using different tools and techniques.

## Pipeline Scripts

The following pipeline scripts are included in this repository:

- GitHub Actions pipeline script (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
- GitLab CI pipeline script (`.gitlab-ci.yml`)
- Jenkins pipeline script (`Jenkinsfile`)
- Azure DevOps pipeline script (`azure-pipelines.yml`)
- AWS CodePipeline script (`codepipeline-script.yml`)
- TravisCI pipeline script (`.travis.yml`)
- CircleCI pipeline script (`.circleci/config.yml`)

Each pipeline script is designed to automate the build, test, and deployment of a simple application, but you can customize the scripts to fit your needs.

## Makefile

Included in this repository is a Makefile, which automates the build and test steps of the pipeline. The Makefile is a simple way to automate repetitive tasks and can be a useful tool for streamlining your pipeline.

## Source Code

The source code for the application being built, tested, and deployed is stored in the `<your-source-code>` directory. Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own projects, or use your own source code by replacing the contents of this directory.

## Contributing

If you have a pipeline script for a different CI/CD technology or an improvement to one of the existing scripts, we'd love to see it! Please open a pull request to contribute to this repository.
